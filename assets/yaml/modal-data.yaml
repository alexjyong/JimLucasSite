arthritis: 
    - fact:
        body: "Cannabinoid receptors, in particular the CB2 receptor, and the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have been found in the joint tissues of arthritis patients, but not in healthy subjects. The endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-AG, are produced naturally in the body, and so this data suggests that the endocannabinoid system is likely part of an anti-inflammatory feedback loop. Targeting the receptors in the endocannabinoid system could help strengthen the anti-inflammatory effect and perhaps be used to treat RA and OA."
